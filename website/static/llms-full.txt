# Authentication

This document provides detailed instructions on how to authenticate with the Tianji API, including obtaining, using, and managing API keys.

## Authentication Method

The Tianji API uses **Bearer Token** authentication. You need to include your API key in the HTTP header of each API request.

### HTTP Header Format

```http
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Obtaining API Keys

1. Log in to your Tianji instance
2. Click on your avatar in the top right corner
4. Find the **API Keys** section
5. Click the + button to create a new API key
6. Name your API key and save it

## API Key Management

### View Existing Keys

In the **API Keys** section, you can see:
- API key name/description
- Creation date
- Last used time
- Usage count statistics

### Delete API Keys

If you need to revoke an API key:
1. Find the API key you want to delete
2. Click the **Delete** button
3. Confirm the deletion operation

:::warning Note
After deleting an API key, all applications using that key will no longer be able to access the API.
:::

## Using API Keys

### cURL Example

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-tianji-domain.com/open/global/config" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key_here>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### JavaScript/Node.js Example

```javascript
const apiKey = '<your_api_key_here>';
const baseUrl = 'https://your-tianji-domain.com/open';

const headers = {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

// Using fetch
const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/global/config`, {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: headers
});

// Using axios
const axios = require('axios');
const response = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/global/config`, {
  headers: headers
});
```

### Python Example

```python

$baseUrl = 'https://your-tianji-domain.com/open';

$headers = [
    'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiKey,
    'Content-Type: application/json'
];

$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $baseUrl . '/global/config');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

$data = json_decode($response, true);
?>
```

## Permissions and Scope

### API Key Permissions

API keys inherit all permissions of their creator, including:
- Access to all data in the user's workspaces
- Execute all operations the user has permission for
- Manage resources created by that user

### Workspace Access

API keys can only access workspaces that the user belongs to. If you need to access multiple workspaces, ensure your user account has appropriate permissions for those workspaces.

## Error Handling

### Common Authentication Errors

#### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "Authorization not provided"
  }
}
```

**Causes**:
- No Authorization header provided
- Incorrect API key format

#### 403 Forbidden

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "Insufficient access"
  }
}
```

**Causes**:
- Invalid or deleted API key
- User doesn't have permission to access the requested resource

### Debugging Authentication Issues

1. **Check API key format**: Ensure you're using the `Bearer token_here` format
2. **Verify key validity**: Confirm the key still exists in the Tianji interface
3. **Check permissions**: Ensure the user account has permission to access the target resource
4. **Test simple endpoints**: Start by testing public endpoints like `/global/config`

===== FILE: docs/application/tracking.md =====

# Application Tracking

Tianji provides a powerful SDK for tracking events and user behavior in your applications. This guide explains how to integrate and use the Application Tracking SDK in your projects.

## Installation

Install the Tianji react native SDK in your project:

```bash
npm install tianji-react-native
# or
yarn add tianji-react-native
# or
pnpm add tianji-react-native
```

## Initialization

Before using any tracking features, you need to initialize the Application SDK with your Tianji server URL and application ID:

```ts

initApplication({
  serverUrl: 'https://tianji.example.com',  // Your Tianji server URL
  applicationId: 'your-application-id'       // Your application identifier
});
```

## Tracking Events

You can track custom events in your application to monitor user actions and behaviors:

```ts

// Track a simple event
reportApplicationEvent('Button Clicked');

// Track an event with additional data
reportApplicationEvent('Purchase Completed', {
  productId: 'product-123',
  price: 29.99,
  currency: 'USD'
});
```

## Screen Tracking

Track screen views in your application to understand user navigation patterns:

### Setting Current Screen

You can set the current screen information which will be included in subsequent events:

```ts

// Update current screen when user navigates
updateCurrentApplicationScreen('ProductDetails', { productId: 'product-123' });
```

### Reporting Screen Views

Explicitly report screen view events:

```ts

// Report current screen view
reportApplicationScreenView();

// Or report a specific screen view
reportApplicationScreenView('Checkout', { cartItems: 3 });
```

## User Identification

Identify users in your application to track their behavior across sessions:

```ts

// Identify a user with their information
identifyApplicationUser({
  id: 'user-123',          // Unique user identifier
  email: 'user@example.com',
  name: 'John Doe',
  // Add any other user properties
  plan: 'premium',
  signupDate: '2023-01-15'
});
```

# Event Tracking

You can track user actions on your website. Tianji provides a simple way to do that.

## Using Script Tag

if you are using script tag, you just need to call `track` function in any where after you inject script

```ts
tianji.track(eventName, data);
```

## Using SDK

if you are using sdk, you just need to call `reportEvent()` function after you `initTianjiTracker()`

```ts

initTianjiTracker({
  url: backendUrl,
  websiteId,
});

reportEvent('Demo Event', {
  foo: 'bar',
});
```


===== FILE: docs/feed/channels.md =====

# Channels

Channels are containers of events. You can create multiple channels for different products/teams/environments.

## Create a channel

Console → Feed → Add Channel.

Fields

- name: Display name
- notifyFrequency: Control how often notifications are sent for this channel
- notificationIds: Select existing notification targets to receive fan-out

## Edit a channel

You can update name, notificationIds, notifyFrequency, and set an optional webhookSignature. Once a signature is set, any public webhook to this channel must include header `x-webhook-signature` with the same value.

## API

- List channels: GET `/open/workspace/{workspaceId}/feed/channels`
- Channel info: GET `/open/workspace/{workspaceId}/feed/{channelId}/info`
- Update: POST `/open/workspace/{workspaceId}/feed/{channelId}/update`
- Create: POST `/open/workspace/{workspaceId}/feed/createChannel`
- Delete: DELETE `/open/workspace/{workspaceId}/feed/{channelId}/del`

Example (update notification targets)

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "$BASE_URL/workspace/$WORKSPACE_ID/feed/$CHANNEL_ID/update" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Ops",
    "notifyFrequency": 60,
    "notificationIds": ["notif_123", "notif_456"]
  }'
```


===== FILE: docs/feed/integrations.md =====

# Integrations

Tianji provides built-in webhook adapters to convert third-party payloads into Feed events.

## GitHub

Endpoint

POST `/open/feed/{channelId}/github`

Notes

- Use "application/json" content type.
- Header `X-GitHub-Event` is required by GitHub and consumed by the adapter.
- Supported types: `push`, `star`, `issues` (opened/closed). Others will be logged as unknown.

## Stripe

Endpoint

POST `/open/feed/{channelId}/stripe`

Notes

- Configure a Stripe webhook endpoint pointing to the URL above.
- Supported types: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.deleted`.

## Sentry

Endpoint

POST `/open/feed/{channelId}/sentry`

Notes

- Header `Sentry-Hook-Resource: event_alert` and action `triggered` are mapped to Feed events.
- See step-by-step screenshots in "Integration with Sentry".

## Tencent Cloud Alarm

Endpoint

POST `/open/feed/{channelId}/tencent-cloud/alarm`

Notes

- Supports alarm types `event` and `metric`. Payload is validated; invalid requests are rejected.

## Webhook Playground

Endpoint

POST `/open/feed/playground/{workspaceId}`

Notes

- Echo headers/body/method/url to the workspace real-time playground for debugging integrations.


===== FILE: docs/feed/intro.md =====

# Feed overview

Feed is a lightweight event stream for your workspace. It helps teams aggregate important events from different systems into channels, collaborate around incidents, and keep stakeholders informed.

## Concepts

- Channel: A logical stream to collect and organize events. Each channel can be connected to one or more notification targets and can optionally require a webhook signature.
- Event: A single record with name, content, tags, source, sender identity, importance and optional payload. Events can be archived/unarchived.
- State: A special kind of ongoing event that can be upserted (created or updated) repeatedly by a stable eventId, and resolved when finished.
- Integration: Built-in webhook adapters that convert 3rd-party payloads (e.g. GitHub, Stripe, Sentry, Tencent Cloud Alarm) into Feed events.
- Notification: Channels can fan-out events to configured notifiers; delivery frequency can be tuned by channel settings.

## Typical use cases

- Product and infra incident stream across multiple services
- CI/CD deployment and release notices
- Billing and subscription signals
- Security, monitoring and error alerts

![](/img/docs/sentry/sentry5.png)

Finally, you can create a alert rule, and you can see `Tianji` in notification section dropdown list

![](/img/docs/sentry/sentry6.png)


===== FILE: docs/feed/state.md =====

# State (ongoing incidents)

Feed State models ongoing incidents with an immutable `eventId`. You can repeatedly upsert updates to the same `eventId` until it is resolved.

## Endpoints

- Upsert state (public): `POST /open/feed/{channelId}/state/upsert`
- Resolve state (auth): `POST /open/workspace/{workspaceId}/feed/{channelId}/state/resolve`
- List ongoing states (auth): `GET /open/workspace/{workspaceId}/feed/state/all?channelId=...&limit=...`

## Upsert body

```json
{
  "eventId": "deploy#2025-08-12",
  "eventName": "deploy_progress",
  "eventContent": "Rollout 60%",
  "tags": ["prod"],
  "source": "ci",
  "senderId": "runner-42",
  "senderName": "GitHub Actions",
  "important": true,
  "payload": {"stage": "canary"}
}
```

If the channel is configured with `webhookSignature`, you must include header `x-webhook-signature`.

## Resolve example

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "$BASE_URL/workspace/$WORKSPACE_ID/feed/$CHANNEL_ID/state/resolve" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"stateId": "STATE_ID"}'
```


===== FILE: docs/install/docker-monitoring.md =====

# Docker Container Monitoring Configuration

## Default Monitoring Behavior

When you install Tianji using Docker or Docker Compose, the system automatically enables built-in server monitoring functionality. By default:

- **Tianji automatically monitors its own container's** system resource usage
- Monitoring data includes: CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network traffic, etc.
- This data is automatically reported to the default workspace without additional configuration
- The container will appear as `tianji-container` in the monitoring dashboard

## Monitoring All Docker Services on the Host Machine

If you want Tianji to monitor all Docker containers and services running on the host machine, not just Tianji itself, you need to map the Docker Socket into the container.

### Configuration Method

Add the following volumes configuration to the `tianji` service section in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  tianji:
    image: moonrailgun/tianji
    # ... other configurations ...
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    # ... other configurations ...
```

### Complete docker-compose.yml Example

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  tianji:
    image: moonrailgun/tianji
    build:
      context: ./
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "12345:12345"
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://tianji:tianji@postgres:5432/tianji
      JWT_SECRET: replace-me-with-a-random-string
      ALLOW_REGISTER: "false"
      ALLOW_OPENAPI: "true"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  # Add this line
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    restart: always
  postgres:
    # ... postgres configuration ...
```

### Using Docker Run Command

If you start Tianji using the `docker run` command, you can add the following parameter:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name tianji \
  -p 12345:12345 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  moonrailgun/tianji
```

## Effects After Configuration

After adding the Docker Socket mapping, Tianji will be able to:

- Monitor all Docker containers running on the host machine
- Obtain container resource usage information
- Display container status information
- Provide a more comprehensive system monitoring view

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Install `isolated-vm` failed

If you are using python 3.12, its will report error like this:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils'
```

Its because of python 3.12 remove `distutils` from builtin module. now we have good resolution about it.

You can switch your python version from 3.12 to 3.9 can resolve it.

### How to resolve it in brew controlled python

```bash
brew install python@3.9
rm /opt/homebrew/bin/python3
ln -sf /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.9
```

then you can check version with `python3 --version`

# Telemetry

## About Anonymous Telemetry

To enhance the user experience, we have **enabled anonymous telemetry by default** in your self-hosted Tianji service.

We understand that data privacy is important to you. Rest assured, this telemetry has the following characteristics:

- **Completely Anonymous**: We do not collect any personally identifiable information or service content.
- **Extremely Limited Scope**: It only includes basic usage data, helping us minimally understand Tianji's usage to continuously improve the product.
- **Fully Transparent**: All telemetry data transmissions can be observed in your service’s network panel, ensuring complete transparency.

Additionally, we fully respect your choice. If you prefer to **disable anonymous telemetry entirely**, simply set the following environment variable:

```bash
DISABLE_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=1
```

For detailed configuration instructions, please refer to the Environment Variables Documentation.

With this approach, we aim to improve Tianji while ensuring privacy and security. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us!

# Troubleshooting

This document collects common issues and their solutions that you may encounter when using Tianji.

## WebSocket Connection Issues

### Problem Description

When using HTTPS services, other functions work normally, but WebSocket service cannot connect properly, which manifests as:

- The connection status indicator in the bottom left corner shows gray
- Server page list shows counts but no actual content

### Root Cause

This issue is usually caused by improper WebSocket forwarding policies in reverse proxy software. In HTTPS environments, WebSocket connections require correct Cookie security policies.

### Solution

You can resolve this issue by setting the following environment variable:

```bash
AUTH_USE_SECURE_COOKIES=true
```

This setting forces the application to treat cookies passed by the browser as encrypted cookies, thereby resolving WebSocket connection issues.

#### Configuration Methods

**Docker Environment:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  tianji:
    environment:
      - AUTH_USE_SECURE_COOKIES=true
```

**Direct Deployment:**
```bash
export AUTH_USE_SECURE_COOKIES=true
```

### Verification Steps

After configuration, restart the service and check:

1. The bottom left connection status indicator should show green
2. Server pages should display real-time data normally
3. WebSocket connections should be established properly in browser developer tools

---

# Introduction

## What is Tianji

One sentence to summarize:

**Tianji** = **Website Analytics** + **Uptime Monitor** + **Server Status**

### Why is it called Tianji?

Tianji(天机, pronunciation Tiān Jī) in chinese which means **Heavenly Opportunity** or **Strategy**

The characters 天 (Tiān) and 机 (Jī) can be translated as "heaven" and "machine" or "mechanism" respectively. When combined, it might refer to a strategic or opportunistic plan or opportunity that seems to be orchestrated by a higher power or a celestial force.

## Motivation

During our observations of the website. We often need to use multiple applications together. For example, we need analysis tools such as `GA`/`umami` to check pv/uv and the number of visits to each page, we need an uptime monitor to check the network quality and connectivity of the server, and we need to use prometheus to obtain the status reported by the server to check the quality of the server. In addition, if we develop an application that allows open source deployment, we often need a telemetry system to help us collect the simplest information about other people's deployment situations.

I think these tools should serve the same purpose, so is there an application that can integrate these common needs in a lightweight way? After all, most of the time we don't need very professional and in-depth functions. But in order to achieve comprehensive monitoring, I need to install so many services.

It's good to specialize in one thing, if we are experts in related abilities we need such specialized tools. But for most users who only have lightweight needs, an **All-in-One** application will be more convenient and easier to use.

## Installation

Install Tianji with Docker is very simple. just make sure you have been install docker and docker-compose plugin

and then, run those command in anywhere:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msgbyte/tianji/master/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

> Default account is **admin**/**admin**, please change password ASAP.

```


===== FILE: docs/monitor/custom-script.md =====

# Custom Script

Compared with traditional monitoring services, **Tianji** supports custom scripts to support more customized scenarios.

Essentially, you can understand it as a restricted, memory safe JavaScript runtime that accepts a number to display on your chart. The most common scenario is the time required for network requests to access an url. Of course, it can also be other things, such as your OpenAI balance, your github star number, and all the information that can be expressed in numbers.

if this script return -1, its means this work is failed, and try to send notification to you, just like normal monitor.

If you want to view the trend of a number's changes, opening the trending mode can help you better discover subtle changes in the number

Here is some example:

## Examples

### get tailchat available service number from health endpoint

```js
const res = await request({
  url: 'https://<tailchat-server-api>/health'
})

if(!res || !res.data || !res.data.services) {
  return -1
}

return res.data.services.length
```

### get github star count

```js
const res = await request({
  url: 'https://api.github.com/repos/msgbyte/tianji'
})

return res.data.stargazers_count ?? -1
```

replace `msgbyte/tianji` to your own repo name

### get docker pull count

```js
const res = await request({
  url: "https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/moonrailgun/tianji/"
});

return res.data.pull_count;
```

replace `moonrailgun/tianji` to your own image name

### example for match text

```js
const start = Date.now();
const res = await request({
  url: "https://example.com/"
});

const usage = Date.now() - start;

const matched = /maintain/.test(String(res.data));

if(matched) {
  return -1;
}

return usage;
```

return `-1` means somthing wrong. in this case, its means in html body include `maintain` text.

### or more

Very very welcome to submit your script in this page. Tianji is driven by open source community.


===== FILE: docs/monitor/push-monitor.md =====

# Push Monitor

Push Monitor is a monitoring method where your application actively sends heartbeat signals to **Tianji** instead of Tianji checking your service. This is particularly useful for monitoring background tasks, cron jobs, or services behind firewalls that cannot be accessed directly.

## How It Works

1. **Tianji** provides you with a unique push endpoint URL
2. Your application sends HTTP POST requests to this endpoint at regular intervals
3. If no heartbeat is received within the configured timeout period, Tianji triggers an alert

## Configuration

When creating a Push Monitor, you need to configure:

- **Monitor Name**: A descriptive name for your monitor
- **Timeout**: The maximum time (in seconds) to wait between heartbeats before considering the service down
- **Recommended Interval**: How often your application should send heartbeats (typically the same as timeout)

## Push Endpoint Format

```
POST https://tianji.example.com/api/push/{pushToken}
```

### Status Parameters

- **Normal Status**: Send without parameters or with `?status=up`
- **Down Status**: Send with `?status=down` to manually trigger an alert
- **Custom Message**: Add `&msg=your-message` to include additional information
- **Custom Value**: Add `&value=123` to track numeric values

## Examples

### Basic Heartbeat (cURL)

```bash
# Send heartbeat every 60 seconds
while true; do
  curl -X POST "https://tianji.example.com/api/push/<your-push-token>"
  sleep 60
done
```

### JavaScript/Node.js

```javascript
// Send heartbeat every 60 seconds
setInterval(async () => {
  try {
    await fetch('https://tianji.example.com/api/push/<your-push-token>', {
      method: 'POST'
    });
    console.log('Heartbeat sent successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to send heartbeat:', error);
  }
}, 60000);
```

### Python

```python
import requests
import time

def send_heartbeat():
    try:
        response = requests.post('https://tianji.example.com/api/push/<your-push-token>')
        print('Heartbeat sent successfully')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'Failed to send heartbeat: {e}')

# Send heartbeat every 60 seconds
while True:
    send_heartbeat()
    time.sleep(60)
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Cron Jobs

Monitor the execution of scheduled tasks:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# your-cron-job.sh

# Your actual job logic here
./run-backup.sh

# Send success signal
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  curl -X POST "https://tianji.example.com/api/push/<your-push-token>?status=up&msg=backup-completed"
else
  curl -X POST "https://tianji.example.com/api/push/<your-push-token>?status=down&msg=backup-failed"
fi
```

### 2. Background Services

Monitor long-running background processes:

```python
import requests
import time
import threading

class ServiceMonitor:
    def __init__(self, push_url):
        self.push_url = push_url
        self.running = True

    def start_heartbeat(self):
        def heartbeat_loop():
            while self.running:
                try:
                    requests.post(self.push_url)
                    time.sleep(30)  # Send every 30 seconds
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Heartbeat failed: {e}")

        thread = threading.Thread(target=heartbeat_loop)
        thread.daemon = True
        thread.start()

# Usage
monitor = ServiceMonitor('https://tianji.example.com/api/push/<your-push-token>')
monitor.start_heartbeat()

# Your main service logic here
while True:
    # Do your work
    time.sleep(1)
```

### 3. Database Sync Jobs

Monitor data synchronization tasks:

```python
import requests
import schedule
import time

def sync_data():
    try:
        # Your data sync logic here
        result = perform_data_sync()

        if result.success:
            requests.post(
                'https://tianji.example.com/api/push/<your-push-token>',
                params={'status': 'up', 'msg': f'synced-{result.records}-records'}
            )
        else:
            requests.post(
                'https://tianji.example.com/api/push/<your-push-token>',
                params={'status': 'down', 'msg': 'sync-failed'}
            )
    except Exception as e:
        requests.post(
            'https://tianji.example.com/api/push/<your-push-token>',
            params={'status': 'down', 'msg': f'error-{str(e)}'}
        )

# Schedule to run every hour
schedule.every().hour.do(sync_data)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Set Appropriate Timeouts**: Configure timeout values based on your application's needs. For frequent tasks, use shorter timeouts. For periodic jobs, use longer timeouts.

2. **Handle Network Failures**: Implement retry logic in your heartbeat code to handle temporary network issues.

3. **Use Meaningful Messages**: Include descriptive messages with your heartbeats to provide context when reviewing logs.

4. **Monitor Critical Paths**: Place heartbeat calls at critical points in your application flow, not just at the beginning.

5. **Exception Handling**: Send a "down" status when an exception occurs in your application.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No heartbeats received**:
- Verify the push token is correct
- Check network connectivity from your application to Tianji
- Ensure your application is actually running the heartbeat code

**Frequent false alarms**:
- Increase the timeout value
- Check if your application is experiencing performance issues
- Review network stability between your app and Tianji

**Missing heartbeats**:
- Add error handling and logging to your heartbeat code
- Consider implementing retry logic for failed requests
- Monitor your application's resource usage

## Security Considerations

- Keep your push tokens secure and don't expose them in public repositories
- Use HTTPS endpoints to encrypt data in transit
- Consider rotating push tokens periodically
- Limit the frequency of heartbeats to avoid overwhelming your Tianji instance

Push monitoring provides a reliable way to monitor services that traditional ping-based monitoring cannot reach, making it an essential tool for comprehensive infrastructure monitoring.


===== FILE: docs/notification/webhook.md =====

# Webhook

If you need a more flexible notification method, you can try using custom webhooks to notify your messages. This way, you can integrate Tianji's notifications into any system.

### Example Result

Tianji system will send a POST request with below example content.

```json
{
    "notification": {
        "workspaceId": "xxxxxxxxxxx",
        "name": "New Notification",
        "type": "webhook",
        "payload": {
            "webhookUrl": "example.com"
        }
    },
    "title": "New Notification Notification Testing",
    "content": "Tianji: Insight into everything\\nThis is Notification Testing from New Notification\\n[image]",
    "raw": [
        {
            "type": "title",
            "level": 2,
            "content": "Tianji: Insight into everything"
        },
        {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "This is Notification Testing from New Notification"
        },
        {
            "type": "newline"
        },
        {
            "type": "image",

        }
    ],
    "time": "2024-06-19T15:41:09.390Z"
}
```


===== FILE: docs/server-status/kubernetes/reporter-daemonset.md =====

# Deploy Reporter as DaemonSet

If you are running Tianji inside Kubernetes, you may want to collect each node's
system metrics. The easiest way is to run `tianji-reporter` as a DaemonSet so it
runs on every node.

1. Edit `docker/k8s/reporter-daemonset.yaml` and replace the `TIANJI_SERVER_URL` and `TIANJI_WORKSPACE_ID` values with your actual server address and workspace ID.
2. Apply the manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply -f docker/k8s/reporter-daemonset.yaml
```

Every node will start a `tianji-reporter` container which reports system
statistics to your Tianji instance. You can check the logs of a specific pod to
ensure it works:

```bash
kubectl logs -l app=tianji-reporter -f
```

Once the pods are running, the **Servers** page in Tianji will list your
Kubernetes nodes just like regular machines.


===== FILE: docs/server-status/server-status-page.md =====

# Server Status Page

You can create a server status page for user to show your server status to public which wanna make others know.

## Configure custom domain

You can config your status page in your own domain, for example: `status.example.com`

set it in page config, and create a `CNAME` record in your DNS dashboard.

```
CNAME status.example.com tianji.example.com
```

then you can visit custom `status.example.com` to your page.

### Troubleshooting

If you will throw 500 error, it looks like your Reverse Proxy is not configured correctly.

Please make sure your reverse proxy include your new status route.

for example:
```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name tianji.example.com status.example.com;
  listen 443 ssl;
}
```


===== FILE: docs/server-status/server-status-reporter.md =====

# Server Status Reporter

you can report your server status easily with tianji reporter

you can download from [https://github.com/msgbyte/tianji/releases](https://github.com/msgbyte/tianji/releases)

## Usage

```
Usage of tianji-reporter:
  --interval int
        Input the INTERVAL, seconed (default 5)
  --mode http
        The send mode of report data, you can select: `http` or `udp`, default is `http` (default "http")
  --name string
        The identification name for this machine
  --url string
        The http url of tianji, for example: https://tianji.msgbyte.com
  --vnstat
        Use vnstat for traffic statistics, linux only
  --workspace string
        The workspace id for tianji, this should be a uuid
```

The **url** and **workspace** is required, its means you will report your service to which host and which workspace.

Default a server node name will be same with hostname, so you can custom your name with `--name` which can help you identify server.

## Auto install script

You can get your auto install script in `Tianji` -> `Servers` -> `Add` -> `Auto` tab

its will auto download reporter and create linux service in your machine. so its need root permission.

### Uninstall

if you wanna uninstall reporter service, you can use this command like:
```bash
curl -o- https://tianji.example.com/serverStatus/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/install.sh?url=https://tianji.example.com | sudo bash -s uninstall
```

The main change is to append `-s uninstall` to your install command.

## Kubernetes

If your servers are running in a Kubernetes cluster, you can deploy the reporter as a DaemonSet so each node reports metrics automatically. See [Deploy Reporter as DaemonSet](./kubernetes/reporter-daemonset.md) for details.

## Q&A

### How to check tianji reporter service log?

If you install with auto install script, tianji will help you install a service which named `tianji-reporter` in your linux machine.

You can use this command to check tianji reporter log:

```bash
journalctl -fu tianji-reporter.service
```

### Not found your machine in server tab even report show success

Maybe your tianji is behind a reverse proxy for example `nginx`.

Please make sure your reverse proxy add websocket support

## Why my machine is always offline?

Please check your server datetime.

===== FILE: docs/telemetry/intro.md =====

# Introduce

## Background

As content creators, we often publish our articles on various third-party platforms. However, for those of us who are serious about our content, publishing is just the beginning. We need to continuously monitor our articles' readership over time. Unfortunately, our data collection capabilities are limited to what each platform offers, which heavily depends on the platform's own capabilities. Moreover, when we distribute the same content across different platforms, the readership and visitation data are completely isolated.

As a developer, I create many software applications. However, once I release these applications, I often lose control over them. For example, after releasing a command-line program, I have no way of knowing how users are interacting with it or even how many users are using my application. Similarly, when developing an open-source application, in the past, I could only gauge interest through GitHub stars, leaving me in the dark about actual usage.

Therefore, we need a simple solution that collects minimal information, respecting personal privacy and other restrictions. This solution is telemetry.

## Telemetry

In the field of computing, telemetry is a common technology that involves the minimal and anonymous reporting of information to accommodate privacy concerns while still meeting the basic analytical needs of content creators.

For example, React's Next.js framework collects information using telemetry: [API Reference: Next.js CLI | Next.js (nextjs.org)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#telemetry)

Alternatively, by embedding a 1px-sized blank transparent pixel image in an article, it's possible to collect visitor data on websites over which we have no control. Modern browsers and most websites block the insertion of custom scripts due to potential security risks. However, an image appears much more harmless by comparison. Almost all websites allow the loading of third-party images, making telemetry feasible.

## What Information Can We Collect Through an Image?

Surprisingly, receiving a single image request allows us to collect more information than one might expect.

By analyzing network requests, we can obtain the user's IP address, visit time, referrer, and device type. This enables us to analyze traffic patterns, such as peak readership times and trends, demographic distribution, and traffic granularity across different platforms. This information is particularly valuable for marketing and promotional activities.

## How Can We Implement Telemetry?

Telemetry is a straightforward technology that essentially requires an endpoint to receive internet requests. Due to its simplicity, there are few dedicated tools for this purpose. Many may not consider analytics important, or they might be deterred by the initial barriers. However, the demand for such functionality is clear.

Developing a telemetry solution is simple. You just need to create a project, set up a route, collect information from the request body, and return a blank image.

Here's an example using Node.js:

```jsx
router.get(
  '/telemetry.gif',
  async (req, res) => {
    const ip = req.ip;
    const referer = req.header['referer'];
    const userAgent = req.headers['user-agent'];

    // Store it in your database

    const blankGifBuffer = Buffer.from(
      'R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7',
      'base64'
    );
    res.header('Content-Type', 'image/gif').send(blankGifBuffer);
  }
);
```

If you prefer not to develop your own solution, I recommend Tianji. As an open-source project offering **Website Analytics**, **Uptime Monitoring**, and **Server Status**, Tianji has recently introduced a telemetry feature to assist content creators in reporting telemetry, thereby facilitating better data collection. Most importantly, being open-source means you have control over your data and can aggregate traffic from multiple platforms in one place, avoiding the fragmentation of viewing the same information in different locations.

# Parameters

Here is some example for how to use and config with telemetry image.

All is optional. its will improve your usage in different place.

| name | description |
| -------- | --------- |
| url | default will get referrer url which auto generate by browser, but in some website will dont allow carry this header, so you have to bring it by your self. if Tianji cannot get url in any where, system will ignore and not record this visit |
| name | define telemetry event name, its can be use for distinguish different event but in same telemetry record. |
| title | **[Badge ONLY]**, define badge title |
| start | **[Badge ONLY]**, define badge start count number |
| fullNum | **[Badge ONLY]**, define badge will show full number, default is abbreviated digits(for example: `12345` and `12.3k`) |

## How to use

Its easy to carry params on url

for example:

```
https://tianji.example.com/telemetry/<workspaceId>/<telemetryId>/badge.svg?name=myEvent&url=https://google.com&title=My+Counter&start=100000&fullNum=true
```

===== FILE: docs/website/framework/install-in-traefik-with-plugin.md =====

# Install in Traefik with plugin

Tianji provides a Traefik plugin that allows you to easily integrate Tianji website analytics functionality into your Traefik proxy.

## Plugin Overview

[traefik-tianji-plugin](https://github.com/msgbyte/traefik-tianji-plugin) is a Traefik middleware plugin specifically developed for Tianji that can automatically inject the Tianji tracking script into your website without modifying your website code to start collecting visitor data.

## Installing the Plugin

### 1. Add Plugin in Static Configuration

First, you need to add the plugin reference in Traefik's static configuration. The plugin version number references the git tag.

#### YAML Configuration

Add the following to your `traefik.yml` or static configuration file:

```yaml
experimental:
  plugins:
    traefik-tianji-plugin:
      moduleName: "github.com/msgbyte/traefik-tianji-plugin"
      version: "v0.2.1"
```

#### TOML Configuration

```toml
[experimental.plugins.traefik-tianji-plugin]
  moduleName = "github.com/msgbyte/traefik-tianji-plugin"
  version = "v0.2.1"
```

#### Command Line

```bash
--experimental.plugins.traefik-tianji-plugin.modulename=github.com/msgbyte/traefik-tianji-plugin
--experimental.plugins.traefik-tianji-plugin.version=v0.2.1
```

### 2. Configure Middleware

After installing the plugin, you need to configure the middleware in the dynamic configuration.

#### YAML Dynamic Configuration

In your `config.yml` or dynamic configuration file:

```yaml
http:
  middlewares:
    my-tianji-middleware:
      plugin:
        traefik-tianji-plugin:
          tianjiHost: "https://tianji.your-domain.com"
          websiteId: "your-website-id"
```

#### TOML Dynamic Configuration

```toml
[http.middlewares.my-tianji-middleware.plugin.traefik-tianji-plugin]
  tianjiHost = "https://tianji.your-domain.com"
  websiteId = "your-website-id"
```

#### Docker Compose Labels

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  my-app:
    image: nginx:latest
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.my-app.rule=Host(`my-app.local`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.my-app.middlewares=my-tianji-middleware"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.my-tianji-middleware.plugin.traefik-tianji-plugin.tianjiHost=https://tianji.your-domain.com"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.my-tianji-middleware.plugin.traefik-tianji-plugin.websiteId=your-website-id"
```

## Configuration Parameters

### Required Parameters

- **tianjiHost**: The complete URL of your Tianji server
  - Example: `https://tianji.your-domain.com`
  - If using the official hosted service: `https://app-tianji.msgbyte.com`

- **websiteId**: The website ID created in Tianji
  - Can be found in the website settings of your Tianji admin panel

### Optional Parameters

The plugin also supports other configuration parameters to customize behavior. For specific parameters, please refer to the [GitHub repository documentation](https://github.com/msgbyte/traefik-tianji-plugin).

## Using the Middleware

After configuration, you need to use this middleware in your router:

### YAML Configuration

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    my-app:
      rule: "Host(`my-app.local`)"
      middlewares:
        - "my-tianji-middleware"
      service: "my-app-service"
```

### Docker Compose Labels

```yaml
labels:
  - "traefik.http.routers.my-app.middlewares=my-tianji-middleware"
```

## How It Works

1. When requests pass through the Traefik proxy, the plugin checks the response content
2. If the response is HTML content, the plugin automatically injects the Tianji tracking script
3. The script starts collecting visitor data and sends it to the Tianji server when the page loads

## Important Notes

- Ensure that the Tianji server address is accessible from client browsers
- The website ID must be valid, otherwise data cannot be collected properly
- The plugin only takes effect when the response content type is HTML
- It's recommended to use the latest version of the plugin for optimal performance and features

# Tracker Script

## Installation

To track website events, you just need inject a simple script(< 2 KB) into your website.

the script look like below:

```html
<script async defer src="https://<your-self-hosted-domain>/tracker.js" data-website-id="xxxxxxxxxxxxx"></script>
```

you can get this script code from your **Tianji** website list

## Report Event

**Tianji** provide a simple way to report user click event, its easy to help you track which action user like and often to use.

This is a very common method in website analysis. You can use it quickly get it by using **Tianji**.

After you inject script code into your website, you just need add a `data-tianji-event` in dom attribute.

for example:

```html
<button data-tianji-event="submit-login-form">Login</button>
```

Now, when user click this button, your dashboard will receive new event

## Modify default script name

> This feature available on v1.7.4+

You can use environment `CUSTOM_TRACKER_SCRIPT_NAME` when you start it

for example:
```
CUSTOM_TRACKER_SCRIPT_NAME="my-tracker.js"
```

then you can visit your tracker script with `"https://<your-self-hosted-domain>/my-tracker.js"`

This is to help you avoid some ad-blockers.

You do not need the `.js` suffix. It can be any path you choose, even you can use as `CUSTOM_TRACKER_SCRIPT_NAME="this/is/very/long/path"`

## Tracking Specified Domains Only

Generally the tracker will report all events wherever your site is running. But sometimes we need to ignore events like `localhost`.

Tianji provides an attribute of the tracker script to do that.

You can add `data-domains` into your script. The value should be your root domains to track. Use `,` to separate multiple domains.

```html
<script async defer src="https://<your-self-hosted-domain>/tracker.js" data-website-id="xxxxxxxxxxxxx" data-domains="website.com,www.website.com"></script>
```

Then you can just see the events from these domains.
