# Worker Agent Skill

The **Tianji Worker Skill** teaches coding agents how to write Worker code and carry out common operations using the dashboard, CLI, and supported management APIs.

<a href="/skills/tianji-worker.tar.gz" download>Download the Tianji Worker Skill (.tar.gz)</a>

The archive contains an installable `tianji-worker` folder with `SKILL.md`, a common-operations guide, and the [Worker Agent Reference](./agent-reference.md). It includes no credentials and requires no MCP server.

## Install

Download and extract the archive into your agent's skills directory. For Codex:

```bash
curl --fail --location https://tianji.dev/skills/tianji-worker.tar.gz \
  --output tianji-worker.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
tar -xzf tianji-worker.tar.gz -C ~/.codex/skills
```

For Claude Code, use `~/.claude/skills`; for Cursor, use `~/.cursor/skills`. If you already installed this skill, review local customizations before replacing its files. Restart or reload the agent session after installation.

## What the agent learns

| Operation         | Guidance included                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create and update | Runtime contract, payload validation, local project setup, deployment, preserving existing settings |
| Test and invoke   | Draft tests, saved-code manual runs, public HTTP requests, and their different effects              |
| Debug             | Execution history, logs, errors, and common configuration problems                                  |
| Configure         | Text/Secret variables, shared-module bindings, cron expressions, and workspace timezone             |
| Maintain          | Revision comparison and rollback, pause/resume, and deletion                                        |

The skill explains the limits of each interface. For example, CLI deployment activates a Worker and can disable its existing schedule; a draft test isolates KV but can still call real external services. It directs the agent to supported dashboard actions where no public API or CLI command exists.

## Example requests

```text
Use tianji-worker to create a Worker that validates an incoming webhook and
forwards its message using a Secret named API_TOKEN. Give me valid and invalid
test payloads. Save the code locally for review.
```

```text
Update Worker <worker-id> in workspace <workspace-id> on <server-url>.
Keep its active state, cron schedule, and environment variables unchanged.
Test the new code before deploying it, then check the execution logs.
```

```text
Inspect the recent failures for Worker <worker-id>, compare its revisions,
and explain which revision could restore the previous behavior.
```

```text
Pause Worker <worker-id> without deleting its code or cron configuration.
```

Provide the target server and workspace through your existing configuration. Keep API keys and Secret values in secure configuration rather than pasting them into prompts. The skill supplies instructions; it does not grant access to your Tianji instance.

## Source and maintenance

The source lives in [`skills/tianji-worker`](https://github.com/msgbyte/tianji/tree/master/skills/tianji-worker). The website build refreshes the bundled runtime reference from the Worker documentation and rebuilds the download. To rebuild it locally:

```bash
pnpm --dir website build:worker-skill
```

For a walkthrough in the dashboard, see [Worker Getting Started](./getting-started.md). For read-only queries across Tianji services, see the separate [Tianji Data Query Skill](../skill/).
